# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `lein lint-fix` — auto-applies `clean-ns` + `format`. Run this first before `lein lint`.
- `lein lint` — clojure-lsp `clean-ns` + `format` + `diagnostics` (surfaces clj-kondo findings).
- `lein test` — run all unit/integration tests (CI uses this).
- `lein test :only guarita.foo-test/bar` — run a single test var.
- `lein run` — start the HTTP service on port 8000. REPL equivalent: `(guarita.components/start-system!)` (returns the Integrant system map; hold it to `ig/halt!` later).
- `lein uberjar` then `lein native` — build the GraalVM native image (optimized, with PGO). Requires `native-image` on `PATH`. The `Dockerfile` handles the full three-step PGO flow; see **PGO build pipeline** below.
- `lein uberjar` then `lein native-pgo` — build the instrumented (non-optimized) native image for profile collection.

## Architecture

Hexagonal architecture with the following layers (each entity gets its own file per layer):

- **`wire/in/<entity>.clj`** — Prismatic/schema for incoming HTTP body shapes. One schema per entity file. Closely related entities (e.g. `Transaction` + `LastTransaction`) share a file. Used by `service.interceptors/wire-in-body-schema` at the route level — not validated inside handlers.
- **`wire/out/<entity>.clj`** — Prismatic/schema for HTTP response body shapes.
- **`wire/postgresql/<entity>.clj`** — Prismatic/schema for DB row shapes (OffsetDateTime, enum strings as returned by PostgreSQL).
- **`models/<entity>.clj`** — Canonical internal domain schemas. Uses `java.time.Instant` for timestamps, keyword enums, boolean predicates (e.g. `online?`, `card-present?`). One entity per file; closely related entities share a file.
- **`adapters/<entity>.clj`** — Conversion functions between layers. Naming: `wire->X`, `postgresql->X`, `X->wire`. Always use destructuring in fn args. Closely related adapters (e.g. `wire->transaction` and `wire->last-transaction`) share a file. The top-level domain adapter (e.g. `adapters/fraud_score.clj`) composes entity adapters.
- **`controllers/<domain>.clj`** — Orchestration: calls db + logic, no HTTP concerns.
- **`logic/<domain>.clj`** — Pure business logic (no I/O, no side effects).
- **`diplomat/http_server/<domain>.clj`** — Pedestal handlers (`s/defn`). Destructure `:json-params` and `:components` from the context map. Call adapters here; delegate to controllers for orchestration.

### Integrant system

Assembled in `src/guarita/components.clj` under the `arranjo` map. Components: config → routes → service. Adding a component means adding a key to `arranjo` and threading it into the `:components` map passed to `::component.service/service`.

**Component definitions**: Local Integrant components (not from libraries) live as separate top-level files at `src/guarita/<component>.clj` (e.g., `dataset.clj`, not `components/dataset.clj`). Import them unaliased to activate their `defmethod` registrations; wire refs to `arranjo`.

### Route registration

Routes live in `src/guarita/diplomat/http_server.clj`. Each route uses interceptors in this order:
1. `io.pedestal.http.body-params/body-params` — parses request body (JSON, EDN, Transit), populates `:json-params`.
2. `io.pedestal.service.interceptors/json-body` — serializes response body to JSON.
3. Handler fn.

Example:
```clojure
(:require [io.pedestal.http.body-params :as body-params]
          [io.pedestal.service.interceptors :as pedestal.service.interceptors]
          [service.interceptors])

["/endpoint"
 :post [(body-params/body-params)
        pedestal.service.interceptors/json-body
        (service.interceptors/wire-in-body-schema {:key schema/Schema})
        handler/fn!]
 :route-name :endpoint]
```

The handler destructures `:json-params` and `:components` from the context map.

### Config

Environment-keyed in `resources/config.edn`; running env (`:prod`) is selected in `components.clj`. Service binds `0.0.0.0:9999` in `:prod`, `0.0.0.0:8001` in `:test`.

### PGO build pipeline

The Dockerfile implements a three-step Profile-Guided Optimization flow entirely inside Docker:

1. **Instrumented build** (`lein do clean, uberjar, native-pgo`) — produces `./target/guarita` with profiling hooks baked in.
2. **Profile collection** — starts the instrumented binary with `-XX:ProfilesDumpFile=./resources/profile-guided-optimizations/profile.iprof`, runs the k6 load test at `resources/profile-guided-optimizations/test.js` (targets `localhost:9999`), then kills the server. The profile is flushed on process exit. `wait $SERVER_PID || true` is required because `kill` + `wait` returns exit code 143 (128 + SIGTERM), which is intentional and must be suppressed.
3. **Optimized build** (`lein do clean, uberjar, native`) — the `native` alias includes `--pgo=./resources/profile-guided-optimizations/profile.iprof`. `lein clean` only removes `./target/`, so the profile in `./resources/` survives.

`profile.iprof` is gitignored and generated at build time only. The k6 stage copies the binary from `grafana/k6:latest` to avoid package-manager installs.

### Reference data

`resources/vectors.bin`, `resources/labels.bin`, and `resources/ivf.bin` are the k-NN reference dataset used by the fraud-scoring controller. They are **generated at Docker build time** and are not checked into git.

- **Source**: [`references.json.gz`](https://github.com/zanfranceschi/rinha-de-backend-2026/blob/main/resources/references.json.gz) from the rinha-de-backend-2026 repo.
- **`vectors.bin`** — N × 14 matrix of `float32` values in little-endian byte order. Each row is one reference transaction's `FraudScoreVector` (the same 14 features produced by `logic.fraud-score/vectorized`). **Cluster-contiguous**: rows are sorted by IVF cluster id so that all points belonging to cluster `c` occupy a flat slice `[offsets[c], offsets[c+1])`.
- **`labels.bin`** — N bytes of `uint8`, in the same row order as `vectors.bin`. One byte per row: `0` = legit, `1` = fraud.
- **`ivf.bin`** — IVF (Inverted File) index. Header: `IVF1` magic (uint32 LE = `0x31465649`), `nlist` (int32 LE), `ntotal` (int32 LE), `dim` (int32 LE). Body: `nlist * dim` float32 LE centroids (row-major, in cluster-id order), then `nlist + 1` int32 LE offsets into `vectors.bin` (cumulative cluster counts).

To regenerate locally (needed for `lein run` / `lein test`):
```
pip install numpy scikit-learn
python3 scripts/generate_dataset.py
```

KNN search lives in `guarita.dataset`. The production path is `knn-ivf` — it scans only the `nprobe` clusters whose centroids are nearest the query, then merges per-cluster top-k results. `nprobe` is a query-time tunable (currently a `def` in `controllers/fraud_score.clj`); higher values trade latency for recall. `knn` (sequential brute force over all N vectors) is kept for recall comparisons and testing.

**Performance optimization**: `sq-dist-buf` uses `FloatBuffer.get(int, float[], int, int)` (bulk copy) instead of 14 individual `.get` calls. This reduces bounds-check overhead from 14 per-element checks to 1 check for all 14 floats, followed by fast primitive array access. The scratch buffer (`float-array 14`) is allocated once per cluster scan in `knn-range` and passed down. This optimization is ~5% CPU reduction in the hot path (Java 13+, supported by GraalVM 23).

## Conventions / gotchas

- `hashp` is auto-injected in the `:dev` profile — `#p form` prints `form` and its value at the REPL. Do not commit `#p` calls.
- Test paths `test/unit`, `test/integration`, `test/helpers` are declared in `project.clj` but the directories don't exist yet; create them when adding the first tests.
- `lein native` is sensitive to reflection — `reflect-config.json` is the place to add reflective classes; `:initialize-at-build-time` is enabled globally via `graal-build-time`.
- `.clj-kondo/config.edn` lint-as's `pg.pool/with-connection` as `let`, hinting that PostgreSQL via `pg.pool` is expected (no DB code in-tree yet).
- The user's global Clojure style guide already governs code style; do not restate it here.

### Testing

- In unit tests prefer a single `match?` map assertion over per-key `is` + `=` checks.
- Extract expected values to namespace-level `def`s; pass them as overrides to `helpers.schema/generate` and reference the symbols directly in the `match?` pattern — avoid `(:key fixture)` extraction inside `match?`.
- Pass predicate functions (e.g. `inst?`, `number?`, `boolean?`) directly as matcher values — no `m/pred` wrapper needed.
- Require pattern: `[matcher-combinators.test :refer [match?]]`.
- Controllers do not need unit tests; they are thin orchestration layers tested via integration tests (HTTP handler → controller → logic).

### Code style preferences

- For chained adapter → controller calls, use thread-first (`->`): `(-> (adapters.X/wire->X wire) controllers.X/X!)`. The first form explicitly calls the adapter; subsequent forms are threaded.
